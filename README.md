## Overview
### Description
OptiCycle is an app that aims to make recycling smarter. It is able to categorize waste for a user, connects users to other recyclers, provides local recycling information, and track's a user's recycling habits.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Education, Social, Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Uses the camera, maps, user location, and real-time object detection
- **Story:** Allows users to enhance recycling experience and expand upon their existing recycling habits and knowledge.
- **Market:** This app is marketed to people who recycle. Even recycling experts could benefit from connecting with other recyclers and learning more about local recycling standards. At launch, we would focus on one college campus and expanding from there.
- **Habit:** Users are able to use this app anytime they have an oppurtunity to recycle. The app aims to create healthier recycling habits.
- **Scope:** The technical goals are manageable. We will be using knowledge and skills that we learned throughout this course except for real-time object detection. The final product has a clear project, once completed, there is tons more we could add to it. It isn't a stripped down version of any app we know of off the app store; therefore, it will be a new product with a large impact.
